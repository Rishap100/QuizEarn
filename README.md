# QuizEarn
It was basically a startup of mine started by me and my two friends.
It is an android quiz app with amazing features like:
  ->Trivia quiz:
      Where user can attempt maximum question in 1 min and your final standing will be shown on the leaderboard based on your score along with other players.
      If one finishes in top 20 we reward them by giving 5 times the money they paid as an entry fees which is 5 rupees only.
   ->Payment:
      A user pay in this app with a help of an integrated upi payment otpion where one can use whichever upi app he/she wants to use to pay entry fees.
   ->Covid-19 info:
      Since this app I made was during covid outbreak with help of my 2 other friends who were living in different parts of this country, I thought of adding a corona meter which       helped one to look what are total cases of covid, number of deaths,etc. It basically was a website created by a friend of mine which used an api which took its data from           the government site.
We use to come up with new quizes daily and the winners were declared by end of each quiz.
Other significant features of this app are:-
1)Amazing UI
2)Google SignIn 
3)A demo quiz for all the users to get familiar with the actual live quiz.

TECHNOLOGY/FRAMEWORK USED:-
1)Android Studio
2)Firebase database
